            <article className='w-[85vw] mt-8 mb-8'>
  <h2 className="text-2xl ">Sensory Memory</h2>
  <p>Sensory memory briefly retains sensory information from the environment, allowing for the perception of the world around us. It has a large capacity but a short duration.</p>
</article>

<article className='w-[85vw] mt-8 mb-8'>
  <h2 className="text-2xl ">Short-term Memory</h2>
  <p>Short-term memory temporarily stores and processes information for immediate use. It has limited capacity and duration, typically holding about 7 items for up to 30 seconds.</p>
</article>

<article className='w-[85vw] mt-8 mb-8'>
  <h2 className="text-2xl ">Long-term Memory</h2>
  <p>Long-term memory stores a vast amount of information over extended periods, ranging from minutes to a lifetime. It has virtually unlimited capacity and can retain knowledge and experiences indefinitely.</p>
</article>

<article className='w-[85vw] mt-8 mb-8'>
  <h2 className="text-2xl ">Episodic Memory</h2>
  <p>Episodic memory stores personal experiences and events, including contextual details such as time, place, and emotions. It enables the recollection of specific past episodes and autobiographical narratives.</p>
</article>

<article className='w-[85vw] mt-8 mb-8'>
  <h2 className="text-2xl ">Semantic Memory</h2>
  <p>Semantic memory contains general knowledge and facts about the world, including concepts, categories, and language. It enables the understanding of language, reasoning, and problem-solving.</p>
</article>

<article className='w-[85vw] mt-8 mb-8'>
  <h2 className="text-2xl ">Procedural Memory</h2>
  <p>Procedural memory stores information about how to perform various skills and procedures, such as riding a bike, typing, or playing a musical instrument. It involves implicit learning and is often acquired through practice and repetition.</p>
</article>


  <h2 className="text-3xl text-yellow-700">Chapter 3: Understanding Memory</h2>

  <article className='w-[85vw] mt-8 mb-8'>
    <h2 className="text-2xl ">Memory Processes:</h2>
    <p>The process of memory involves several stages, including:</p>
    <ol>
      <li className='list-decimal'>Encoding: Encoding is the process of converting sensory input into a form that can be stored in memory, such as visual images, sounds, or semantic meaning.</li>
      <li className='list-decimal'>Storage: Storage involves maintaining encoded information over time, which can occur in sensory memory, short-term memory, or long-term memory.</li>
      <li className='list-decimal'>Retrieval: Retrieval is the process of accessing and bringing stored information into conscious awareness when needed, allowing for recall or recognition of past experiences or knowledge.</li>
    </ol>
  </article>

  <article className='w-[85vw] mt-8 mb-8'>
    <h2 className="text-2xl ">Factors Affecting Memory:</h2>
    <p>Memory can be influenced by various factors, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li className='list-disc'>Attention: Paying attention to information is essential for successful encoding and subsequent retrieval. Divided attention or multitasking can impair memory performance.</li>
      <li className='list-disc'>Emotion: Emotional arousal can enhance memory consolidation and retrieval, leading to better recall of emotionally significant events or experiences.</li>
      <li className='list-disc'>Stress: Acute stress can enhance memory formation, particularly for emotionally arousing or threatening stimuli, while chronic stress can impair memory function.</li>
      <li className='list-disc'>Sleep: Adequate sleep is crucial for memory consolidation, with sleep stages such as REM sleep playing a significant role in processing and integrating new information into long-term memory.</li>
      <li className='list-disc'>Neurotransmitters: Neurotransmitters like acetylcholine, dopamine, and serotonin play key roles in modulating memory processes and synaptic plasticity.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2 className="text-3xl text-yellow-700">Chapter 4: Improving Memory</h2>

  <article className='w-[85vw] mt-8 mb-8'>
    <h2 className="text-2xl ">Memory Improvement Techniques:</h2>
    <p>There are various strategies and techniques that can help improve memory:</p>
    <ul>
      <li className='list-disc'>Mnemonic Devices: Mnemonics are memory aids that use patterns, associations, or imagery to facilitate recall, such as acronyms, visual imagery, or the method of loci.</li>
      <li className='list-disc'>Rehearsal: Rehearsal involves repeatedly reviewing or practicing information to strengthen encoding and retention, such as through rote rehearsal or elaborative rehearsal.</li>
      <li className='list-disc'>Chunking: Chunking involves grouping information into smaller, manageable units or chunks, making it easier to remember and process larger amounts of information.</li>
      <li className='list-disc'>Visualization: Creating vivid mental images or visual representations of information can enhance memory encoding and recall, particularly for abstract or complex concepts.</li>
      <li className='list-disc'>Association: Creating meaningful associations or connections between new information and existing knowledge can improve memory retrieval, as the brain tends to remember information in context.</li>
      <li className='list-disc'>Spacing Effect: Distributing study or practice sessions over time, rather than cramming all at once, can enhance long-term retention and reduce the likelihood of forgetting.</li>
      <li className='list-disc'>Testing: Testing yourself on the material through practice quizzes or self-assessment can strengthen memory retrieval and identify areas for further review or reinforcement.</li>
      <li className='list-disc'>Physical Exercise: Regular physical exercise has been shown to improve cognitive function, including memory, by promoting neurogenesis, enhancing synaptic plasticity, and reducing the risk of cognitive decline.</li>
      <li className='list-disc'>Healthy Lifestyle: Maintaining a balanced diet, staying hydrated, getting adequate sleep, managing stress, and avoiding substance abuse can support overall brain health and memory function.</li>
